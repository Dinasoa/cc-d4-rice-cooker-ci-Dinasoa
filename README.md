The Rice Cooker is a simple Scala program that simulates the behavior of a rice cooker. It allows you to plug and unplug the cooker, turn it on and off, and add rice and water for cooking.

## Usage

1. **Installation**

   Make sure you have Scala installed. Compile the code using the Scala compiler (`scalac`):

   ```bash
   scalac main.scala riceCooker.scala
   ```
2. **Run the application**

   Execute the compiled program

   ```bash
   scala Main
   ```

## Features


```
    1. Plug/Unplug: Control the power supply to the Rice Cooker.
    2. Turn On/Turn Off: Activate or deactivate the cooking process.
    3. Add Rice/Water: Insert rice or water into the Rice Cooker for cooking.
    4. Get Status: View the current status of the Rice Cooker, including power state and inserted quantities.
```

## Constraints

__Capacity__: The Rice Cooker has a maximum capacity of 900 units (e.g., grams or milliliters) for both rice and water combined.
